### Updates:

* Button to clear Whiteboard from Ros Smartpad.
+ RVIZ show the points saved in a matrix of circles, wich blue means PTP point, green means LIN point, and red means no point saved.
+ now it is easier to save the points with:
  NEXT --> SAVE POINT
  Instead of:
  Select combo box --> SAVE POINT
